# VaultOS Systems — Offline Continuity Engine

VaultOS Systems builds **offline relay nodes** and secure vaults for continuity during
**shutdowns, disasters, or censorship events**. VaultOS provides **signed snapshots** 
and **low-bandwidth relays** (QR/USB/LoRa) so communities can maintain civic state even 
when the internet is unavailable.

## Mission
Ensure that digital civic infrastructure remains **usable and trustworthy under disconnection**.

## Features
- **Snapshot Specification** — canonical serialization and signature verification
- **Store-and-Forward Pipeline** — resumable sync across nodes
- **Multi-Transport** — QR codes, USB drives, LoRa mesh relays
- **Recovery & Re-entry** — Shamir-based recovery and offline voting re-entry

## Governance & Legal
